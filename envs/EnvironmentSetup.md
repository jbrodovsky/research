# Environemnt Setup

At the moment this repo uses two Python environments. Namely because PyGMT doesn't seem to play well with others and it is only really used as a easy to use interface for GMT to download and crop maps.

Two setup scripts are provided: `setup.sh` and `setup.ps1` for use on Linux and Windows respectively. These scripts assume `conda` is installed and is your main package manager for Python. If it is not, use the descriptions in the `.yml` files to manually build the environments.
