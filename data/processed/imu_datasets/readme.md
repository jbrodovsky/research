# IMU Datasets

These datasets were taken using a Google Pixel 6a with the [Sensor Logger](https://github.com/tszheichoi/awesome-sensor-logger) app. Their intended use is for geophysical navigation testing and will require full mechanization in addition to geophysical map-matching.

Each dataset contains the truth GPS values, uncalibrated IMU outputs, vector magnetometer readings, and barometer readings (both total pressure and relative change in height).
