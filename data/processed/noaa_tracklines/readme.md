# NOAA Marine Trackline Datasets

These data were obtained from NOAA's [Marine Trackline Geophysical Data](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/marine-trackline-geophysical-data). Conversely to the IMU datasets, these do not contain IMU values and constitute more of a survey dataset rather than and inertial navigation dataset. However, they are long duration, and velocity information can be inferred.

Pre-processing needs to be reworked so that the index is a datetime.
